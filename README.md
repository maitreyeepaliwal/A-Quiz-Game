# A-Quiz-Game
This project mainly focuses on algorithms and basics of data structure concepts. 
It contains complex iterations and functions. The array and structure concepts are used to implement the project. 
This quiz generally works on the data stored in the code. It is a single choice correct type questions quiz, and the score obtained is displayed at the end of a game. 
The code implementation is in JavaScript and HTML programming languages, styled using CSS, giving it a presentable outlook.

Aim:
The main aim of creating this project on questionnaire on DSA is that
this kind of system can be used in Schools/Colleges for conducting the
Quizzes. This project is designed in Java Script and HTML, and styled
using CSS. As a part of the project different variables, functions and
strings have been used. It will be very convenient and easy for the users
to operate and understand. This project does not contain any kind of
error and even warning contents. The user won’t find it difficult to use
and navigate i.e., its user friendly. And it does not has a complex
outlook, thus making it easier to use for the first time too. The app also
has a proper detailed instruction menu.
Objective:
The objective of this questionnaire game is to facilitate user friendly
environment for all the players. In the past days quiz used to be
conducted manually but in further resolution we are able to generate
score.
Applicability of the proposed work:
It can be used in different schools and colleges to conduct various
quizzes. The project will result in easy and efficient way to conduct the
quizzes. It is completely free from errors. And has a basic outlook,
making it comfortable for new users to interact. The user won’t find it
difficult to use and navigate. A progress bar indicates the fraction of
questions done.
Introduction:
The project is implemented using JavaScript and HTML as
programming language, and is styled using CSS.
The data structure used is ‘array’. Various functions are performed on
this 2D array. Each array element contains a question, 4 options, and
the correct answer.
I’ve stored a total of 10 questions in the code and set the max no. of
questions to be asked in the quiz as 5. This can be changed according
to the needs of the body organizing the quiz.
 Each question is compulsory
 Every question has 4 options, out of which only 1 is correct
 For every correct answer, 10 points are awarded
 There is no negative marking
 Once answered, it cannot be modified and the next question will
be displayed immediately
 A correct answer is indicated by a green colour, while an incorrect
answer is indicated by a red colour
 A progress bar is displayed on the top left, which indicates the
number of questions answered
 The score obtained is displayed on the top right, which indicates
the score obtained till the point
 Once all the questions are answered, the final score is displayed
on the screen.


The possible future enhancement include:
 Adding multiple choice questions.
 Storing data in more organized way in database.
 A tab for viewing high scores can be introduced.
 User feedback option can be introduced.
